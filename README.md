The development is still in progress  
Backend:  
Springboot project is back-end directory  
Use IDEA or eclipse to run the backend(for some reason java -jar instruction doesn't work very well)  

Frontend:   
Front-end version for Node.js has to be above 18  
Under the Directory use npm install and npm run dev to run frontend
